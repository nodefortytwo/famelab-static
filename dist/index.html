                <h2>What is FameLab?</h2>
                <p>FameLab is a communications competition designed to engage and entertain by breaking down science, technology and engineering concepts into three minute presentations. Contestants from around the world take part armed only with their wits and a few props that they can carry onto stage – the result is an unpredictable, enlightening and exciting way to encourage your curiosity and find out about the latest research.</p>
                <p>FameLab was started in 2005 in the UK by Cheltenham Science Festival and has quickly become established as a diamond model for successfully identifying, training and mentoring scientists and engineers to share their enthusiasm for their subjects with the public.</p>
                <p>Working in partnership with the <a href="http://www.britishcouncil.org/">British Council</a> this global competition has already seen more than 5000 young scientists and engineers participating in over 25 different countries. <a href="http://famelab-eeb.arc.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> has license to deliver the competition in the USA in the field of planetary sciences.</p>
